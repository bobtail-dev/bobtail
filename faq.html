<p><strong>Why did you guys rename Reactive Coffee to Bobtail?</strong></p>
<p>There were a few reasons. First, the name Reactive Coffee is rather uncomfortably close to
<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, which, while a wonderful framework, is completely
unrelated. There's also the implication in the name "Reactive Coffee" that this is a CoffeeScript framework. While it's
true that this was originally developed in CoffeeScript, and CoffeeScript's terse syntax lends many advantages, there's
absolutely no reason you can't use JavaScript or TypeScript with Bobtail. So why Bobtail? We decided to rename it for
the Kurilian Bobtail, a <a href="http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/cats-101/videos/kurilian-bobtail/">
particularly adorable breed of cat</a> native to the Kuril islands. And if any animal in nature can be described as
"reactive", felines definitely qualify.</p>
<p>Also the name bobtail was free on NPM and Bower, so yeah... there's that too.</p>
<p><strong>Why yet another client-side framework?</strong></p>
<p>See <a href="design.html">Motivation and Design Rationale</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How does Bobtail stack up against the many other client-side frameworks?</strong></p>
<p>See <a href="related.html">Related Work</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Isn&#39;t this approach just reverting back to the PHP days of mixing markup
and logic?</strong></p>
<p>Bobtail is designed for rich application development.  Rather than focusing on
the division between markup and logic, Bobtail focuses on separating models
from views and on the component abstraction.  Components must encapsulate not
just markup, but also behavior.  The two should be coupled, not separated.</p>
<p>This library also takes the stance that logic-less is generally a counter-productive
endeavor---the logic-less-ness and associated gains are primarily superficial, readability can be <em>adversely</em>
affected, and it does not separate concerns.  Others have <a href="http://boronine.com/2012/09/07/Cult-Of-Logic-less-Templates/">written</a> <a href="http://www.ebaytechblog.com/2012/10/01/the-case-against-logic-less-templates/">more</a>
on this.</p>
<p><strong>Why jQuery / what is the relationship between Bobtail and jQuery?</strong></p>
<p>The library just uses jQuery as a cross-browser interface to the DOM for its
own operations.  All tags are wrapped in jQuery objects.  You don&#39;t need to use
jQuery, but jQuery excels as a cross-platform API and is probably the most
popular of managing low-level DOM operations.  Although jQuery is known to not
scale very well, higher-level application structure is where Bobtail steps in.</p>
<p><strong>Why the syntax noise in the template language?</strong></p>
<p>This is actually not set in stone.  The framework could handle a more concise
template syntax.  For instance, it&#39;s certainly feasible to support a language
in which one of the above examples could be rewritten as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">div</span> <span class="s">&#39;.sidebar&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="nx">h2</span> <span class="s">&#39;Send a message&#39;</span>
  <span class="nx">form</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nv">action: </span><span class="s">&#39;/msg&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">method: </span><span class="s">&#39;POST&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="nx">input</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nv">type: </span><span class="s">&#39;text&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">name: </span><span class="s">&#39;comment&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">placeholder: </span><span class="s">&#39;Your message&#39;</span><span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="nx">select</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nv">name: </span><span class="s">&#39;recipient&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">[</span>
      <span class="nx">option</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nv">value: </span><span class="s">&#39;0&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="s">&#39;John&#39;</span>
      <span class="nx">option</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nv">value: </span><span class="s">&#39;1&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="s">&#39;Jane&#39;</span>
    <span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This would be closer to the concision of languages like Slim and Jade:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sidebar</span>
  <span class="nx">h2</span> <span class="nx">Send</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="nx">message</span>
  <span class="nx">form</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">action</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;/msg&#39;</span> <span class="nx">method</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;POST&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nx">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;text&#39;</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;comment&#39;</span> <span class="nx">placeholder</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;Your message&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nx">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;recipient&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="nx">option</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;0&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nx">John</span>
      <span class="nx">option</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;0&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nx">Jane</span>
</pre></div>

<p>However, the project currently errs on the side of more conservatively adding
syntax to the DSL, and defaulting to strictness.</p>
<p><strong>Why not use Knockout observables?</strong></p>
<p>Bobtail originally tried simply reusing KO, but ultimately divorced itself
since there are both desired features that are missing (differences in array
event propagation, topologically ordered batch propagations, etc.) and features
that are unwanted (mis-matched programming model, larger API surface area,
etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose to use <code>rx</code> as the namespace?  You know about Reactive
Extensions, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s cited in the list of <a href="related.html">Related Work</a>.  We chose <code>rx</code> because short
namespaces are convenient and it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;re using RxJS if you&#39;re
using Bobtail, but please correct us if we&#39;re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to sprinkle <code>rx.cell()</code> everywhere in my model?</strong></p>
<p>You actually don&#39;t.  At one extreme, you can always fall back to just wrapping
your entire model in a single cell, and re-render everything on changes, which
is sufficient for small/simple applications.</p>
<p>However, there are other benefits to systematically using <code>rx.cell()</code> besides
its performance scalability, including debugging and introspection of what the
DAG of dependencies looks like in a running application (on a finer granularity
than &quot;views depend on model&quot;).  Additionally, applications may want to manually
create subscriptions to events only on parts or certain cells of the model, in
which case referencing cells is the clearest and most direct way to do so,
rather than needing to compute diffs on your full model.</p>
<p>An in-between optimization would be to have a system that figures out the diffs
for you (variants of which are found in other frameworks including Angular and
React), such that at least DOM changes are localized.  For more complex
applications, though, where you may have multiple &quot;layers&quot; of models and
view-models, cells scale.  Also, in the future, we may get the best of both
worldsâ€”take a look at <code>Object.observe</code>.  For more on these directions, see
<a href="ideas.html">Ideas</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use this from JavaScript?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can.  The main benefit of using CoffeeScript here is that it has a
very DSL-friendly syntax for Bobtail&#39;s declarative UIs, and particularly
for the terse anonymous function syntax to represent the incrementally
recomputable bindings.  Otherwise, it&#39;s pretty similar. With the addition of arrow
functions to ES6, this is now considerably easier, though note that all ES6 arrow functions
bind to the external <code>this</code>. This is a particular issue when writing event handlers, where
overwriting the default <code>this</code> (which refers to the element on which the event was triggered)
is often undesirable.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth showing a quick example of what that would look like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">$sidebar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">rx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bind</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span>
  <span class="nx">div</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="kr">class</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;sidebar&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="nx">h2</span><span class="p">({},</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Send a message&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="nx">form</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="nx">action</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/msg&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">method</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;POST&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">[</span>
      <span class="nx">input</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;text&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;comment&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">placeholder</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Your message&#39;</span><span class="p">}),</span>
      <span class="nx">select</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;recipient&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="nx">users</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">user</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span>
        <span class="nx">option</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="nx">user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">user</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">]);</span>
      <span class="p">}))</span>
    <span class="p">])</span>
  <span class="p">])</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>
<p><strong>What about TypeScript?</strong></p>
<p>We've not had the chance to experiment too much with TypeScript, but we are hope to add support and
a TypeScript definition file for the framework. Like ES6, TypeScript comes with fat arrow functions.</p>
