<p>There is no shortage of client-side framework for building rich web app UIs.
This section will mainly focus on trade-offs and differences; to be clear,
these are all just opinions of the original author, who has deep respect
for the work of these other library authors, and liberally draws
inspiration from them.  Ideally, there wouldn&#39;t have been a need to create
Bobtail.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any of the multitude of declarative UI toolkits based on reactive
programming, especially FRP in the Haskell universe, but also <a href="https://bling.codeplex.com/">Bling</a>,
<a href="http://www.flapjax-lang.org/">FlapJax</a>, and others rooted more in the programming languages community.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Specifically in JS land: <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout</a> in terms of the mechanics behind
observables and computed observables, but with fewer moving parts and API
surface (no read/write interception, context management, etc.).  Bobtail
originally tried simply reusing KO, but ultimately divorced itself since
there are both desired features that are missing (differences in array event
propagation, topologically ordered batch propagations, etc.) and features
that are unwanted (mis-matched programming model, larger API surface area,
etc.).</p>
<p>For its HTML-based template language it uses a micro-syntax in <code>data-bind</code>
attributes to bind to element properties to expressions.</p>
<p>A number of reactive programming libraries in JS besides <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout</a> including
<a href="http://www.reactjs.com/">React.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fynyky/reactor.js">Reactor</a>, <a href="http://reactive-extensions.github.io/RxJS/">RxJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js">bacon.js</a>.  Some of these libraries
also aren&#39;t quite the same in that they still require you to explicitly
specify the subscriptions and use combinators to merge different streams.</p>
<p>Bobtail is more similar to <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout</a> than it is to
<a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone</a> (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6340870/43118">this
Stack Overflow answer</a> for more).</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://angularjs.org">Angular</a> is a popular framework that emphasizes testability.  The
template language extends HTML with its own directives.  Unfortunately it
employs much more magic, has a steep learning curve, and is significantly
larger and more complex.  Khan Academy&#39;s Ben Alpert&#39;s critique is not
uncommon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Angular documentation for how to write a directive (a reusable component)
needs to explain directive priorities, the difference between compiling and
linking, the creation of new scopes, and transclusion, all of which are
Angular-specific concepts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There exist numerous other critiques of Angular---here&#39;s but a small
sample:</p>

</ul>
<p>Angular eschews change listeners for model diff computation.  This is to be
distinguished from React&#39;s view diff computation—Angular does not need to
construct a lightweight DOM to diff since it is aware of the dependencies,
since its bindings are restricted to simple path-like accessors against the
current scope (with optional filters).  However, it must compute changes
in the model in a process it calls <em>dirty checking</em>, which does not scale
and has historically been source of code complexity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember</a> offers its own template language that feels right at home if you are
coming from a server-side templates background.  It has a
Mustache-ish template language that, like Angular, uses simple
path-like accessors against the current context, but with a mix of
Ember-specific directives such as action, link, bindAttr, outlet,
helpers, etc.  The framework introduces its own class/object model, and
also uses explicit Controller objects to tie together models and views.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer</a> for its brazen use of new but unstable technologies such as
<code>Object.observe</code>, Web Components, and Shadow DOM.  Some good ideas here, but
there&#39;s still a good deal of platform/tooling immaturity as well as more
verbose scaffolding around creating components and defining reactive
behaviors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> shares a similar approach of leveraging a full programming language
(JS) rather than a more restrictive template language for declaratively
assembling UI components, as well as a similar focus on only one-way data
bindings.  Beyond view rendering, React does not provide reactive programming
primitives for the rest of your application.</p>
<p>React encourages use of JSX, which is a syntactic transform over JS and comes
with its own set of <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/reactjs/gcRqGANsy40">subtle</a> <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-is-not-html.html">differences</a> from HTML, besides
the usual <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/reactjs/IzRlS2mBbKs">complexities of integration into existing frameworks and
pipelines</a>.</p>
<p>It imposes a more heavyweight component model with a more complex API that
has a greater surface area.  There are a number of core concepts to learn:
properties, refs, state, &quot;classes&quot;, mixins, lifecycle management
(<code>component[Will|Did]Mount</code>, <code>unmountAndReleaseReactRootNode</code>, etc.),
property transfer, controlling update propagation (<code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>,
<code>componentWillReceiveProps</code>, etc.), and more.  React also requires its own
way of doing things such as low-level DOM manipulation—something that
Bobtail intentionally delegates to jQuery.</p>
<p>React, like <a href="https://github.com/drcode/webfui">WebFUI</a>, re-constructs a lightweight representation of the
entire updated DOM and computes diffs to determine what actual DOM
operations to execute.  Programmability-wise, this is not as
straightforward as working with the actual DOM objects, requiring some
awkward concepts such as refs, and this does lead to some tricky
situations involving the predictability of re-rendering and also the
control of things such as <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/reactjs/0.4/reactjs/-XHqDfKN5Ws/KbdNuGTg6IkJ">element focus</a>.  Performance-wise, the
approach is adequate for certain classes of applications/contexts, though
the process takes on the order of 1ms in a modern desktop/laptop browser
for simple applications such as TodoMVC.  For other applications or on
mobile devices, performance/battery life do unfortunately matter.  This
is more frequently the case as rich client-side application complexity
grows.  Consider a browser-based Photoshop clone—smooth dragging controls
affecting a small number of on-screen components cannot incur the
full DOM diff algorithm per frame.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/visage">Visage</a>, formerly known as JavaFX, introduces incremental evaluation in a
statically typed scripting language for the JVM.  It focuses on building
Swing UIs.  Bobtail was actually originally inspired by its approach, which
is also one of using a full programming language to host the declarative UI
construction, along with its intuitive syntax for creating bindings.  JavaFX
used compile-time transforms to implement incremental evaluation.</p>
