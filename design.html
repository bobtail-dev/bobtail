<p>With so many client-side model-view web frameworks out there, why create yet
another one?  What&#39;s so special about this one?</p>
<p>The goals of this particular framework include:</p>
<ul>
<li>scaling well in both performance and code architecture to large/complex
applications</li>
<li>having simple foundations in composable primitives</li>
<li>minimizing &quot;magic&quot;</li>
<li>enabling declarative expressiveness even for complex data-bound views</li>
</ul>
<p>Bobtail actually consists of two layers.  At its core, it provides reactive
programming primitives that allow users to declaratively specify arbitrary
dataflow DAGs, where data structures are automatically updated in response to
updates in their dependencies.  This is in lieu of the heftier first-class-event
systems like <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>.  The idea is that all application
dependencies, including high-level business logic and domain-specific concepts,
are conveniently represented by (potentially complex) data types built out of
observable cells.</p>
<p>The second layer in Bobtail is that of the &quot;template language,&quot; the DSL for
constructing UIs out of not only DOM elements but arbitrary user-defined
components as well.</p>
<p>A major benefit of embedding into a host language that is a full-fledged
programming language, rather than creating a limited template language, is that
the system now inherits the abstractions and expressive power of the host
language for free.  For instance, defining reusable component abstractions is
as simple as.  The ability to define reusable components, and the manner in
which they are assembled together, is at the core of what makes for scalable
architecture, and this is an aspect that Bobtail makes very simple/natural.  Plus, we
inherit all the expressivity of the host language, control flow (loops and
conditionals), variables, expressions, and so forth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by avoiding the creation of a new language (even simple syntactic
transforms), we retain all the benefits of the tooling around an established
host language, such as source maps, syntax highlighting, linting, comment doc
processing, compiler implementations, etc.</p>
<p>The syntax leverages some features of CoffeeScript to achieve the expressive
power of a declarative HTML-ish template language:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/%5Bextensibility%5D-writing-DSLs">general malleability</a> for DSLs, esp. for declaring structures</li>
<li>concise anonymous function definitions for delimiting bindings to re-compute</li>
<li>string interpolation</li>
<li>reuse any code you&#39;ve already written</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, because we are simply writing CoffeeScript, we have all the
flexibility and code which that brings to the table, useful for shaping data
for the views as well as for specifying component behavior.</p>
<p>Bobtail is designed for rich application development.  This is a
developer-centric framework that does not pretend to be something that is used
by designers or tools (which is not to say it does not fit in a workflow
involving both developers and designers).  Rather than focusing on the division
between markup and logic, Bobtail focuses on separating models from views,
enabling complex UIs (such as recursively structured DOMs), and on the
component abstraction.  Components must encapsulate not just markup, but
also coupled with behavior, which should be <em>frictionless</em> to add,
particularly on account of the embedded DSL implementation.</p>
<p>The framework needs to scale well to more complex front-ends, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>web page editor where the model is the DOM, CSSOM, etc. of a web page, and
views are not just editing controls but also the <em>fully rendered web page
itself</em></li>
<li>data analysis tool involving sizeable amounts of data and detailed
visualizations over the data, where individual data points are represented in
the visualizations</li>
</ul>
<p>This is achieved by enabling large/deep model dependencies to be built out
of the reactive programming primitives, as well as allowing for precise
control over the binding and re-rendering of the DOM templates.  Bobtail
avoids relying on computing diffs between models or between generated
views, so as to minimize latency for UI updates even for large, complex
applications.</p>
<p>Finally, Bobtail also aims to be a compact framework.  The
documentation/website you&#39;re now reading is significantly longer than the
code.  Bobtail focuses only on bindings and templates, and nothing else.
This is the &quot;Flask-over-Django&quot; approach of choosing best-of-breed
libraries for different concerns.  For instance, certain frameworks also
include a routing subsystem; we recommend using instead <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6315505/preferred-client-side-routing-solution">stand-alone,
dedicated libraries for routing</a>, such as <a href="https://github.com/flatiron/director">Flatiron Director</a> to
parse routes from <a href="https://github.com/browserstate/history.js">History.js</a> events.</p>
